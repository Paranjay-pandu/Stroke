        <h1>Body Mass Index (BMI)</h1>
        <p>BMI is a tool used to estimate body fat based on height and weight. It's a simple calculation but doesn't directly measure body fat. However, it can be a helpful indicator of potential health risks associated with weight.</p>

        <h2>BMI Categories and Meanings</h2>
        <p>Here's a breakdown of BMI categories and their meanings according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
            <th>BMI Range</th>
            <th>Weight Status</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>Below 18.5</td>
            <td>Underweight</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>18.5 to 24.9</td>
            <td>Healthy Weight</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>25.0 to 29.9</td>
            <td>Overweight</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>30.0 and Above</td>
            <td>Obese</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>**Important Note:** BMI is a general guideline. It may not be as accurate for people with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Very muscular builds (muscle weighs more than fat)</li>
            <li>Older adults (muscle mass may decrease with age)</li>
            <li>Pregnant or breastfeeding women</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you have concerns about your weight or BMI, talk to your doctor. They can consider your BMI along with other factors for a more personalized assessment of your health.</p>
